### Team Speak 3 Server

Rocket Blast of course has a Team Speak 3 server, this is open to everyone not just administrators and can be found here - ts3.rocketblast.com this is also a good place to find an admin should you need one. If you are an admin and want admin powers on our TS3 server please speak to Sam.

### Slack

Slack is an instant messaging service we use to speak to each other, on slack we have a variation of bot, one of these bots will tell us when a player is being reported and why, for example;
